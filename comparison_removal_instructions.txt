// Instructions for removing "So sánh & Gợi ý" JavaScript code

Since we removed the "So sánh & Gợi ý" (Comparison & Suggestions) section from the HTML, 
we need to remove the related JavaScript code as well. Here are the parts to remove:

1. In the updateAllPerformanceMetrics function (around line 2165):
   Find and remove or comment out this line:
   ```
   updatePerformanceAnalysis(gamePerformance, graphicPerformance, officePerformance, livestreamPerformance, renderPerformance);
   ```

2. Remove the entire updatePerformanceAnalysis function (around lines 2170-2225)

3. Remove the entire addRecommendation function (around lines 2227-2233)

4. Search for and remove any other references to updatePerformanceAnalysis (like line 2836)

5. Check for and remove any code that references these IDs:
   - price-performance-chart
   - optimization-suggestions
   - performance-tip
   - selected-game-name
   - future-upgrade-suggestion
   - basic-comparison
   - pro-comparison
   - creator-comparison
   - installment-6, installment-12, installment-18
   - alternative-configs

This will ensure all related JavaScript functionality is removed along with the HTML section.

// Additional Instructions for removing "Hiệu Năng Dự Kiến" (Expected Performance) section

We also need to remove the "Hiệu Năng Dự Kiến" (Expected Performance) section from the HTML,
along with all related JavaScript code. Here are the parts to remove:

1. In the HTML file, remove the entire section with id="system-performance" (from line 477 to around line 580)
   ```
   <section id="system-performance" class="selection-section">
       ...
   </section>
   ```

2. Remove or comment out the following JavaScript functions in buildsan.js:
   - updateAllPerformanceMetrics (around line 2114)
   - updatePerformanceDisplay (around line 1410)
   - updateProgressBar (around line 1441)
   - calculateGamePerformance (around line 2071)
   - calculateGraphicsPerformance (around line 2097)
   - calculateOfficePerformance (around line 2106)
   - updatePerformanceChart (around line 2654)
   - initPerformanceChart (around line 2579)
   - displayDetailedPerformance (around line 2236)

3. Also remove or comment out any calls to these functions, especially:
   - All instances of updateAllPerformanceMetrics() calls
   - Any references to performance-chart, game-performance, graphic-performance, etc.

4. Look for and remove/comment out JavaScript that initializes or references these elements:
   - document.getElementById('performance-chart')
   - document.getElementById('game-performance')
   - document.getElementById('graphic-performance')
   - document.getElementById('office-performance')
   - document.getElementById('livestream-performance')
   - document.getElementById('render-performance')
   - document.getElementById('bottleneck-indicator')
   - document.getElementById('bottleneck-percentage')

This will ensure that all code related to the performance section is properly removed from the website.
